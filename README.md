## About

Work In Progress

This is the beginning framework for the react version of kelownafoodspecials.com. This uses Redux to authenticate a user's access to a custom management portal which in turn accesses Firebase to create and manipulate data.

An .env file with your firebase credentials placed in your root will be required to setup the firebase database.

## Installation

* `npm i` installs the dependencies
* `npm start` starts the project
